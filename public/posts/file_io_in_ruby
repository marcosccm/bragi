Ruby offers a very powefull API for File IO, allowing for very complex 
operations with very little code, but the myriad of methods and classes with 
similar names can be a little confusing for the Ruby uneducated like me.

### The File Class

The *File* class, built in the language (you don't have to require it), offers the most commonly 
nedded facilities for manipulating files in Ruby. Like all other IO things in Ruby,
*File* is an subclass of the *IO*, which mixes in the *Enumerable* module. 
Let's go over the basics.

### Reading from a File

The simplest way to get a file is just calling *File.new* with the corret path 
(you get an exception otherwise). You can then call *File.read* to get the entire 
content of the file as a string. 

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  f = File.new("lib/file.rb")
  content = f.read
  f.close
</pre>

That may suffice for some simple uses, but most of the times we want a little more 
control. You can read the file line by line with the *File.readline* method or the
*File.gets* method. The difference is that *File.readline* throws an exceptions if the
file is over, while *File.gets* just returns nil.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  f = File.new("lib/file.rb")
  while line = f.gets
    puts line
  end
  f.close
</pre>

You can also read the file char by char, with the *File.readchar*, or byte by byte
with the *File.readbyte*. Both have their get* counterpart, with similar behaviour
to those described above. The amount of bytes in a file depends on the encoding. 

Since *File* is an *Enumerable*, you can also use *File.each* or *File.each_line* 
to loop through the file and access each line with a block.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  f = File.new("lib/file.rb")
  f.each do |line|
    #do something with the line
  end
  f.close
</pre> 

You can have even more read precision by moving the *File* "inner pointer" with more low level
methods like *File.seek*.

### Writing into a File

To write into a file you must first open it on write or append mode. Write mode creates the file
if it does not exist or overwrites the old version, and is indicated by a second argument 'w'
passed to the *File.open* method. Append mode creates a file if it doesn't exist or appends to the
existing content, and is indicated by the 'a' flag.

The methods used to write on a *File* instance are *puts*, which places a newline after the content, or
*print*, that does not append the newline. You can also use *File.write*, witch returns the number
of bytes written into the file.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  f = File.new('lib/file.rb', 'w')
  f.puts("a new line will be appended")
  f.print("no new line")
  f.print(" at all")
  puts f.read
  >> "a new line will be appended\nno new line at all"
  f.close
</pre>

### Using blocks

When you use the *File.new* method, you have to manually close the file with the
*File.close* method. That is quite boring and also prone to mistakes. 
A better aproach is the *File.open* method, that pass the file to a 
code block and then closes the file for you. The *open* method accepts the same filemode 
flags as *new*. If you provide no code blocks, *File.open* is identical to *File.new*.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  File.open("lib/file.rb") do |f|
    f.each do
      #do something
    end  
  end
</pre>

### The Enumerability of Files

The fact that *File* is an *Enumerable* gives the class a lof of nifty abilities.
Its a little strange at first, thinking about files as an array of lines, but you get used to it
very quickly. Here are some cool samples.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  #counting commented lines 
  File.open("lib/file.rb").count{ |line| line.starts_with?("#") } 

  #get all the file require lines as an array
  File.open("lib/file.rb").grep(/^include/)

  #the avg of words from each line
  File.open("lib/file.rb").inject(0) do |total, line|
    total += line.split.size
  end
</pre>
