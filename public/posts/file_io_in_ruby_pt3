Wraping up our series on Ruby File IO, we will now delve on the two Standard Library components that complements 
the core ruby IO API, the *FileUtils* module and the *Pathname* class.

### The *FileUtils* Module

The *FileUtils* module brings an interesting approach to file manipulation, by emulating a ton of file related 
Unix commands, and its most commonly used flags. The effects of comands like *rm -rf* and *ln -s* are done by
calling the *FileUtils.rb_rf* and *FileUtils.ln_s* methods. 

Since they follow a syntax known by most ruby developers, the *FileUtils* methods are very straightforward to 
understand, making a list of *FileUtils* method calls really feels like a bash session. The following 
sample ilustrates that similarity.

<pre class="brush:ruby">
  require "fileutils"

  FileUtils.touch(["some_file.rb", "another_file.rb"])
  FileUtils.mkdir("code")
  FileUtils.mv(["another_file.rb", "../other_file.rb"], "code")
  
  Dir["code/*"]
  >> ["code/some_file.rb", "code/another_file.rb"]
  
  FileUtils.cp_r("code", "bkp")
  FileUtils.rm_r("code") 
  
  Dir["code/*"]
  >> []
  Dir["bkp/*"]
  >> ["bkp/some_file.rb", "bkp/another_file.rb"]
</pre>

Like Unix commands, most *FileUtils* methods knows how to deal with multiple files by recieving arrays as parameters,like the *FileUtils.cp* method. They also accepts flags to change its behavior.

<pre class="brush:ruby">
  require "fileutils"

  FileUtils.rm("a_file.rb") # removes this file
  FileUtils.rm(Dir["bkp_*"]) # remove all files that start with bkp
  FileUtils.rm(Dir["bkp_*"], :verbose => true) #print the equivalent stmt and remove the bkp files 
</pre>

### The Pathname Class

The Pathname class represents a pathname, the location of a file on the underlying filesystem, and provides 
facilities for querying and manipulating filepath data.  

Although not universally usefull as the *FileUtils* module, the *Pathname* class can bring in a lot of niceties 
when you need to do heavy filesystem transversing, and it is used on gems like Sprockets and Carrierwave. 

You create a *Pathname* object by passing a string with the filesystem path to the class constructor. You can also
get *Pathnames* by joining two paths with *Pathname.join* or *Pathname.+*. Also, most *Pathname* methods return
*Pathname* objects.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  require "pathname"

  path = Pathname.new("/home/marcos/projects")
  >> Pathname:"/home/marcos/projects"
  
  other = path.join("bragi")
  >> Pathname:"/home/marcos/projects/bragi"
</pre>

A *Pathname* object can provide a lot of information about its underlying filepath, like its parent path, dirname,
whether it is a absolute or relative path, whether it represents a file or not, and so on.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  require "pathname"

  path = Pathname.new("/home/marcos/projects")
  path.dirname   # Pathname: "/home/marcos/"
  path.basename  # Pathname: "/home/marcos/projects"
  path.parent    # Pathname: "/home/marcos/"
  path.file?     # false
  path.absolute? # true
  path.relative? # false
</pre>

*Pathname.ascend*  iterates and yields a *Pathname* object for each element in a given path on an ascending order.
*Pathname.children* returns an array with all the sibilings of a given path, and *Pathname.each_child* iterates 
over then.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
  require "pathname"

  path = Pathname.new("/home/marcos/projects")
  path.ascend { |x| puts x }
  >> Pathname: "/home/marcos/projects"
  >> Pathname: "/home/marcos/"
  >> Pathname: "/home/"
  >> Pathname: "/"

  path.each_child { |x| puts x }
  >> Pathname: "/home/marcos/projects/bragi"
  >> Pathname: "/home/marcos/projects/mimir"
  >> Pathname: "/home/marcos/projects/guard-clone"
</pre>

*Pathname* also offers facades for many methods found on the *File* and *Dir* classes, allowing you to write 
cleaner code in some cases.

One gotcha is that most *Pathname* methods, including its constructor, are just wrappers around string 
manipulations, and will happily accept any string you throw at it, but some methods, like *Pathname.children* and 
*Pathname.realpath* access the filesystem and will raise errors if the *Pathname* object does not represent an 
actual filesystem path.
